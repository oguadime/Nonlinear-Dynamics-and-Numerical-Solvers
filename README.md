# Nonlinear-Dynamics-and-Numerical-Solvers
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of numerical methods for solving nonlinear dynamic equations. Methods include Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Convexity Splitting with both fixed and adaptive time-stepping. These approaches demonstrate stability, convergence, and energy properties.
